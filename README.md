# Story

## As a traveler ,I want to be able to plan the perfect vacations and I need to know how is it going to be the weather  in the country that I am going, at least for the next five days.

 ### GIVEN a weather dashboard with form input, when I search for a city then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
### WHEN I view current weather conditions for that THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

### We used for this project:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Moment() **to display the current time**
* [Open Weather site](https://openweathermap.org/)
**This last one was used for the API**
